# Terms of Service for the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension
These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern the use of the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension ("the Extension"). By using the Extension, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please refrain from using the Extension.

## 1. Free and Purchased Credits
1.1 The Extension offers a trial period through the provision of free credits. These free credits are provided to users for the purpose of experiencing the features of the Extension before purchasing additional credits.

1.2 Credit purchases are final.

1.3 Notwithstanding item 1.2, should the the provider of the Extension decide to discontinue the Extension, the provider retains the right to buy back the remaining valid (i.e., unexpired) credits. In particular, this would be done by issuing a partial refund on the user's last order. The percentage of the partial refund will be equal to the percentage of unused credits.

1.4 The provider of the Extension retains the right to not sell additional credits.

1.5 Both free and purchased credits are subject to the expiry date. Once the credits expire, they are subject to removal from the account.

1.6 When a user's account reaches zero or a negative balance of valid credits, there is a two-week window to replenish them. If credits are not purchased within this period, the account will be considered inactive. Acknowledging that unforeseen circumstances may cause delays, we provide an additional two-week grace period during which the user's account, in its entirety, is retained. Following this grace period, both the user's account and any associated data are subject to removal. Please note that once a user's account or its associated data is removed, restoration is not possible.

## 2. Rates

2.2 The rates are subject to change. Furthermore:

- Currently flat rates may become dependent on factors like the amount of indexed content.
- Currently dependent rates may change to either flat rates or to depend on another set of factors.
- Storage, account, and other fees not presently in effect, may be introduced.

2.3 The provider will make every effort to inform users at least 48 hours before the updated rates take effect, by utilizing one or more of the following methods:

This 48-hour notice period allows users to review the changes and make any necessary adjustments to their usage or credit purchases in response to the rate change. It's part of our commitment to transparency and fairness.

## 3. Extension Functionality
3.1 The Extension interacts with the target websites (e.g. YouTube) to obtain captions on behalf of the user. This feature is designed to enhance the user experience by eliminating the need to obtain the captions manually.

3.2 In the event that technical or legal constraints arise, rendering the retrieval of captions technically or legally impossible, or if changes to target websites disrupt this feature, the affected feature may become temporarily unavailable until a suitable solution is found. In such cases, the provider will make every effort to inform users as soon as possible, utilizing one or more of the following methods:

- By sending an email to the user's registered email address.
- By displaying a notification within the Extension.

The provider aims to provide this notification within a reasonable timeframe considering the specific circumstances.

3.3 If restoration of the captions retrieval feature proves infeasible, the Extension may continue to offer its searching capability. In such cases, users shall not be entitled to any form of compensation.

4.4 Failure to comply with the responsibilities outlined in items 4.1-4.4 above may result in actions taken by the provider, which may include the suspension or termination of user accounts, as deemed necessary to uphold the integrity of the service and the rights of other users. If an account is suspended, the credits become unusable; if terminated, the credits are lost.

## 5. Modification of Terms

This 48-hour notice period allows users to review the changes and make any necessary adjustments to their usage or credit purchases in response to the change in the Terms. It's part of our commitment to transparency and fairness.

5.2 Continued use of the Extension after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
